# Al-Kabir Polytechnic College App

The Al-Kabir Polytechnic College App, developed during my time at Al-Kabir Polytechnic College in Jamshedpur, serves as a valuable digital hub for students and faculty. This dedicated application streamlines access to essential college notifications and consolidates external resources related to Jharkhand University of Technology, creating a convenient one-stop platform.

## Key Features

- **One-Stop Platform:** Access external websites affiliated with Jharkhand University of Technology for academic resources, examination schedules, and other university-related information.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed with a user-friendly interface using the Sketchware application to enhance the overall user experience.

## Discontinuation

## Technical Details

The app is a frontend application, not relying on a database. It was constructed using the Sketchware application to create the user-friendly interface.
